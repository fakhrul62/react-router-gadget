The project involves creating a responsive e-commerce platform for GadgetHaven, a gadget-focused online shopping site, following a detailed Figma design. The website will include a structured navigation bar, organized product categories, and dedicated product detail pages. Essential features are a shopping cart, a wishlist system, and product filtering options. To manage these features, the Context API will be used for handling the cart and wishlist, with the option to store data in LocalStorage for persistence. Additional pages will enable users to view and manage their cart and wishlist, sort items by price, and enhance the overall user experience. The platform should also be able to handle edge cases, such as price limits and reload errors, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.
